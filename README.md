## Install

``` bash
npm install --save thorify
npm install --save web3 # Web3 is needed as dependency.
```


## Usage

``` javascript
// ES6 style
import { thorify } from "thorify";
const Web3 = require("web3");		// Recommend using require() instead of import here

const web3 = thorify(new Web3(), "http://localhost:8669");

web3.eth.getBlock("latest").then(res => console.log(res));
// Best block info will be displayed
```

If you would like to write code in ES5, check below for the initialization code.

``` javascript
// ES5 style
const thorify = require("thorify").thorify;
const Web3 = require("web3");

const web3 = thorify(new Web3(), "http://localhost:8669");

web3.eth.getBlock("latest").then(res => console.log(res));
// Best block info will be displayed
```

## Send Transaction

In Thor official implementation , the client **DOES NOT** neither manage user's private-key/keyStore nor use private key to sign a Transaction. Unfortunately, thorify can not directly perform `eth_sendTransaction` but there is another way to sign a transaction.

In [web3.js accounts](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#eth-accounts), it gives the opportunity to add your private-key, stored in your runtime context (In Node.js context, it's stored in memory while in Browser context, it's stored in memory/local storage), to accounts module. When you are trying to send a transaction, the module will check the private key associated with from field. Once the private key and from have been matched, the module will sign the transaction.
The APIs that follows the mechanism are:

+ `web3.eth.sendTransaction()`
+ `contract.deploy.send()`
+ `contract.methods.myMethod.send()`

## Documentation

[API Reference](https://vechain.github.io/thorify/#/?id=api-reference)

## Play with multi-clause

1. [thor-devkit.js](https://github.com/vechain/thor-devkit.js) supports multi-clause and sign transaction
2. send signed transaction using [sendSignedTransaction](https://vechain.github.io/thorify/#/?id=send-signed-transaction)

## FAQ

### Web3-Gear vs Thorify

Thor only supports RESTful API other than ethereum's JSON-RPC, so we developed two component for the developers familiar with ethereum's develop kits. `Web3-Gear` is a standalone program that accepts JSON-RPC calls and transforms the requests to thor's RESTful API and `Thorify` is an extended web3 that sends the request directly to thor's RESTful API.So,

+ If you are writing smart contract using [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/)/[remix-ide](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or other tools that uses original web3, you should use `Web3-Gear`.

+ If you are writing some application or scripts executing in `Node.js` or `Browser` environment, you should use `Thorify`.

### How do I send VTHO token

VTHO is a token that compatible with VIP180(ERC-20), you can build a contract instance using `web3` and do what ever you want.

+ [VTHO source code](https://github.com/vechain/thor/blob/master/builtin/gen/energy.sol)
+ Contract Address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000456E65726779`

### Multi party payment protocol or sponsored contract

It's done by calling the functions of prototype contract, check [wiki page](https://github.com/vechain/thor/wiki/Prototype(EN)) for detailed info about prototype contract.

### Method not supported

The RESTful API of Thor is different with Ethereum's JSON-RPC, therefore, there are some methods in web3 are not supported by thorify, feel free to open an issue discuss the features.

There is a possibility that when you trying to call `sendTransaction` or `send` functions, thorify will return `Method not supported` under version 0.3.1, due to account module will check the private key associated with `from` field. After upgrade to version 0.3.1 or newer, thorify will show `The private key corresponding to from filed can't be found in local eth.accounts.wallet ` to make an error more specific.

## Notes

- There are three special block number in Ethereum: `earliest`,`latest`,`pending`. In VeChain Thor, we introduced `best` block and there is no `pending` block, so they will be replaced with `0` (aka genesis), `best`, `best`

## Compatibility

    Currently, `thorify` is compatible with `web3@1.0*`.
